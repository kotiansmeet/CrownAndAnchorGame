1. The initial dice rolls are random. The first die value selected here is “CLUB”.
2. The second die value selected at random is “HEART”.
3. The third dice value is “HEART”.
4. In subsequent rolls, the same dice values are retrieved, in the same order as previously, because Dice.value is never set to the new value when Dice.roll() is called.
5. The subsequent dice value is retrieved in sequence.
6. The Dice.roll() method is edited to remove the unused return value, and ensure that a new value is assigned to the Dice.value variable.
